# Feature Request: Multilingual Community Awareness Demo UI for PiDualTx

---

## Summary

I propose adding a **multilingual, interactive awareness/demo UI** for the PiDualTx community, which can be used as a safe, educational entry point for new and existing users. This initiative aims to clarify the concept of dual-value transactions and PiDualTx’s smart features in a real-world style—without any risk or real wallet/network connection.

---

## Motivation

- **Community Onboarding:** Many users seek a risk-free environment to understand the workflow before engaging with the actual system.
- **Awareness:** Helps prevent user mistakes and raises overall understanding and transparency.
- **Inclusivity:** With support for Arabic, English, and French (and easy extensibility), the demo ensures accessibility for a global user base, especially underrepresented communities.

---

## Proposed Solution

- **Standalone HTML File:**  
  - Fully interactive, standalone HTML file (`PiDualTxCommunityDemo.html`) that works on any browser or device (PC or mobile) without dependencies.
  - Can be opened locally or hosted on GitHub Pages.
  - No installation or setup needed.

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  - Arabic, English, French out-of-the-box (easy to add more).
  - Dynamic language switcher in the UI.

- **Rich Interactive Features:**  
  - Welcome/disclaimer section.
  - Demo transaction form (internal/external/AI types).
  - Market analytics (dummy rates, AI prediction).
  - Transaction history (demo entries).
  - Wallet settings (connect/disconnect, language, shield, UI customization).
  - Support section.

- **Safe Demo Environment:**  
  - All data is for demonstration only—no real wallet/network connections.

- **Customizable:**  
  - All texts, labels, and features are easily editable for future needs.
